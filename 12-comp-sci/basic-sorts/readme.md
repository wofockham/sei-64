# Basic Sorts Exercises

## Overview
There are two exercises to help you practice what you learned in the Basic Sorts lesson by implementing the two sorting algorithms:
* `BubbleSort.js`
* `Insertion Sort.js`

This folder also contains test scripts that you can use on your code.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for [Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778) before completing these exercises.

> **Note**: The myGA module links out to a CodePen for code challenges for both bubble sort and insertion sort. **Those exercises are the same as the ones here and are meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercises.**
