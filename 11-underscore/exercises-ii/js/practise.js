// ## Exercises

// - Sort the ` people ` by 'uid'
console.table(_(people).sortBy('uid'));

// - Group the random words by the lower case version of their first letter
const firstLowerLetter = function (word) {
    return word[0].toLowerCase();
};
console.log( _(words).groupBy(firstLowerLetter) );

// - Check to see if all the words have more than 3 characters
const moreThan3 = function (word) {
    return word.length > 3;
};
console.log('all words have more than 3 characters', _(words).every( moreThan3 ));

// - Check if some words are over twenty characters long
const moreThan20 = function (word) {
    return word.length > 20;
}
console.log('some words have more than 20 characters', _(words).some( moreThan20 ));

// - Get an array of all of the uids in ` people `
console.log( _(people).pluck('uid') );

// - Find the person with the highest uid
console.log( _(people).max('uid') );

// - Return an object that says how many even numbers and how many odd numbers there are in ` numbers `
// - Get three random numbers out of ` numbers `
