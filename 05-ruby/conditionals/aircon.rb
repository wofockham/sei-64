#     - If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C now!  It's hot!"
#     - If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is below the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C whenever you have the chance...  It's cool..."
